											<h3>Path to Software Developer</h3>
										</header>
										<p>My journey began when I worked as an Autonomous Vehicle Operator at a tech startup in Fremont, CA. They needed help setting up the environment for their new hardware (laptops, desktops, etc.) and I volunteered one day to help. It was honestly very basic stuff like setting up Linux and running a few lines of code provided ahead of time but that's all it took to get me <strong>hooked</strong>.</p>
										<p>I became curious on what entailed this magical realm of software engineering and began self-studying the digestible language of <strong>Ruby</strong> along with HTML and CSS basics. After spending a few months practicing and feeling relatively confident in the ability to understand the language and markup I decided to take it to the next level and go <strong>full-time</strong> learning software. I enrolled in App Academy, one of the leading bootcamps in the Bay Area with a 5% acceptance rate to their fullstack immersive program. I was very fortunate to be surrounded by hard working individuals who aided in my understanding of new languages and frameworks like <strong>Javascript, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and jQuery</strong>. I've also had the amazing opportunity and support to create my first full stack web application inspired by Discord (<a href="https://github.com/Shaphen/Badcord" target="_blank">Badcord</a>).</p>
										<p>My recent experiences have brought me where I am today and I am excited to continue my journey forward further expanding on my knowledge development and contributing to users all across the web.</p>
